  "The verdict -> phase mapping for the ISCO-08 3522 telecommunications
  engineering technicians actor, and what each phase is allowed to do.

  Runtime: portable `.cljc` (pure functions over data, no host interop).

  Why this namespace exists. The mapping used to be an inline `cond` inside
  the StateGraph's `:decide` node. Being inline, it could only be exercised by
  building and running a graph, so the routing rule that decides whether a
  test result is written, held, or sent to a human had no test of its own and
  no name a ledger entry could carry.

  Three phases, and the ordering between them is the whole safety claim:

    :hold             hard violation. Never written. Not overridable.
    :request-approval escalation. Written only after a human resumes.
    :commit           clean. Written.

  `of-verdict` checks `:hard?` before `:escalate?` deliberately. A proposal
  that is both hard-blocked and low-confidence must hold, not escalate —
  escalating it would put a question to a human that they have no authority to
  answer yes to. For this actor that is not hypothetical: a service restoral
  is an escalating operation *and* one that can breach the registered
  attenuation ceiling, so the two conditions coincide on exactly the request
  most likely to be waved through — the one whose premise is that the link
  already failed."

  ledger can distinguish a human-approved write from an automatic one —
  measured on the pre-change tree, it could not: a service restoral approved
  by a human and a routine test result approved automatically left two
  `{:disposition :commit ...}` entries with no field telling them apart. For a
  link being returned to production carriage after a failure, that
  distinction is the entire reason the interrupt exists."
