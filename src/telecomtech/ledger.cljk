  "Append-only audit ledger for the ISCO-08 3522 telecommunications
  engineering technicians actor: entry construction, hash chaining, and
  verification.

  Runtime: portable `.cljc`. The chain hash is a pure polynomial over the
  entry's printed form, chosen so that both Clojure and ClojureScript compute
  the *same* number: intermediate values stay below 2^36, well inside the
  exactly-representable integer range of a double, so no host-specific 32-bit
  wrap or BigInt is involved. `hash` from clojure.core was not used because it
  is explicitly not stable across runtimes.

  Why this namespace exists. The store held the ledger as a vector and the
  README called it append-only, but nothing in the value made a dropped or
  reordered entry detectable: any prefix of the ledger, and any permutation of
  it, was indistinguishable from the real thing. 'Append-only' was a property
  of the code path, not of the artifact — and the code path is exactly what an
  audit is trying to check. For a record of which link tests were accepted as
  conforming, that is the difference between an audit that can show which
  attenuation readings were approved and one that can only show which readings
  someone chose to leave in the file.

  Separately, the ledger could not answer the question this actor's
  human-approval interrupt exists to answer. Measured on the pre-change tree,
  a service restoral committed through human sign-off and a routine test
  result committed automatically both produced `{:disposition :commit ...}`
  with no field distinguishing them. `commit-entry` therefore takes the
  approval provenance as part of the record, not as an afterthought."

  truncation needs an external anchor (a signed head), which this in-memory
